# GENERAL MODEL STRUCTURE BASED ON CHRIS'S INITIAL MODEL
# Cov_event_mod <- gam(plant_hits/point_samples ~ 
#                        Year*Period*Zone*Origin +  	# fixed effects for year (1-4), period (before/after), treatment zone (bank elev), and origin (native/exotic) and their interactions
#                        Grazing + 			# Fixed effect of grazing (binary, pres/absent)
#                        s(Transect, bs='re') +		# Random effect for Transect
#                        s(Site, bs='re'),      		# Random effect for Site
#                      #s(System, bs='re') +		# Random effect for System, not to be implemented in pilot analysis
#                      data=Data_springfresh_subset, family=binomial("logit"), method='REML' )
# 
# JY RECOMMENDATION: build up to this from a simple base, don't try really high
#    level interactions to start
#
# For richness, consider flow metrics, zone, period, grazing, origin, wpfg,
#    maybe work towards zone * period interactions and zone * flow_metrics
#    interactions with random effects for waterbody, site, transect, survey_year
# 
# For cover, use a similar structure but add hits_tm1 as an additional fixed predictor
#    to set up an autoregressive structure (see examples below)
#
# Consider TMBB models, or whatever works best given data amount
#
# Model distributions:
#   1. Richness: start with Poisson, consider Negative Binomial or zero-inflated Poisson if issues
#   2. Cover (autoregressive): consider Poisson with offset(npoint) (shown below),
#        but could also calculate proportional cover (hits / npoint) and use
#        a zero-inflated lognormal. Need to include hits_tm1 on the link scale 
#        in the same model (see below, becomes log_hits_tm1 for poisson, would be
#        log_proportional_cover_tm1 in lognormal model)
